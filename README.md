An unmanned vehicle distribution system aims to solve the problem of high time consumption and low collection of express delivery for students.

Campus express delivery outlets are relatively scattered and not close to dormitory areas, and there are still "last mile" pain points in the express delivery industry. After understanding the demand for express last-mile delivery services on university campuses, the team intends to develop an unmanned vehicle delivery system with the goal of intelligent delivery mode to solve the problem of high time consumption and low collection of express delivery for students.
